Exception Handling in OOP:
Create a class Calculator with a method divide(int a, int b)
that throws a custom exception DivisionByZeroException if b is zero.
Handle this exception in a main method.

Abstract Classes:
Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method calculateArea().
Implement this method in subclasses Circle and Square.
